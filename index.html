		<p>I'm a Technology Leader with diverse background in Retail, Healthcare, and Supply Chain.  I have degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration and a lot of experience to boot.  I love to build high performing teams who know how to have fun.  Let's get this done!</p>
		<p>My Hobbies:</br> <FONT COLOR="009900">  I'm a happy gardener.  I love to see the fruits of my labor;</FONT><br>  I run with purpose!  Why else would anyone run? </p> 
		<p><span><a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p></span>

		<p>Okay, this site is boring and colorless, that won't last long.  Just imagine beautiful gardens and a sweaty dude running and maybe a couple little white dogs and a couple big black dogs.  </p>
