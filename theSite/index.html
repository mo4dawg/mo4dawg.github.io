<p>I need to give a couple citations:
  The primary pattern I used was from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this </a> website hosted by Jonathan McGlone. If you follow his instructions step by step you will end up with a plain grey site with no photos or interesting details but you will find it a robust platform for building your site.</p>
  <p>To get started is free, just go to github.com and sign-up and you will end up with a site called <i>username</i>.github.io.  My next step was to go to Go Daddy and buy my own site.  See my blog dated May 24.  From there I was able to redirect my new site name, kevinjconnell.com to the GitHub site where it is hosted.</p>
  <p>You can download for free a GitHub app but I found it easiest to do all my work directly on the site.  There are a couple tutorials to show you how the tool works.  Remember Git is basically a code repository.</p>
  <p>I used Google a lot and I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">www.w3schools.com </a> because web development has grown up since I last played with it.</p>
  <p>Photos were an interesting trick.  I created an Issue and drug the photo into the issue comments.  Then after the issue is saved I right clicked on the photo and copied it's link address into the html.  This was one of those discoveries through Google.  Also, make your photos small, compressed to 336X448 or so.  For alignment use tables.  Do not use frames!</p>
  <p>The latest enhancement was adding the tags so blog posts can be categorized.  It was difficult to get the new page to blend into the sitebut again I found a great foundational start <a href="https://blog.meinside.pe.kr/Adding-tag-cloud-and-archives-page-to-Jekyll/">here</a>.  I was surprised to see this worked.  But the formatting took me a couple hours to fix.</p>
  <p>Lastly this site is  work in progress.</p>
  <p>Cheers!</p>
