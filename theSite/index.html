  <h2>About kevinjconnell.com</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>This website was built with Jeckyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</li>
      <li>This site is <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive</a> in that all browsers will work with it on all form factors.</li>
      <li>This site is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"> WCAG 2.0</a> compliant.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>I decided to build the site from scratch just for fun rather than use GitHub pages which have some nice templates.  The primary pattern I used to create the site was from <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"><b> this </b></a> website hosted by Jonathan McGlone. &nbsp;If you follow his instructions step by step you will end up with a plain grey site with no photos or interesting details but you will find it a robust platform for building your site.</p>
  <p>To get started is free, just go to github.com and sign-up and you will end up with a site called <i>username</i>.github.io.&nbsp;  My next step was to go to Go Daddy and buy my domain name.  &nbsp;I was super excited to find kevinjconnell.com available. &nbsp;See my blog dated May 24.  &nbsp;From there I was able to redirect my new site name, kevinjconnell.com to the GitHub site where it is hosted.</p>
  <p>You can download for free a GitHub app but I found it easiest to do all my work directly on github.com. &nbsp;There are a couple tutorials to show you how the tool works.  &nbsp;Remember Git is basically a code repository so it is check out, edit, and then commit.  &nbsp;For complex changes you can use a branch but I just went for it on the main branch.  If you mess up you can also revert back or compare to a previous version.</p>
  <p>I used Google a lot and I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">www.w3schools.com </a> because web development has grown up since I last played with it.</p>
  <p>Photos were an interesting trick. &nbsp; I created an Issue on my GitHub site and drug the photo into the issue comments. &nbsp;An issue is a bug report and is handled separately from your web pages.  &nbsp;After the issue is saved I right clicked on the photo and copied its link address into the html.  &nbsp;This was one of those discoveries through Google.  &nbsp;Also, make your photos small, compressed to 336 x 448 or so.  &nbsp;For alignment use tables.  &nbsp;Do not use frames! &nbsp;I also played around with resizing as you mouseover and mouseout the photos.  I included an additional larger size if you click on the photos.</p>
  <p>The primary font used is Google's Roboto, sans-serif.  The header and footers are a playful dichotomy of Comic MS Sans.  Fonts continue to be an area of experimentation and change.</p>
  <p>A later enhancement was adding the tags so blog posts can be categorized.  &nbsp;It was difficult to get the new page to blend into the site but again I found a great foundational start <a href="https://blog.meinside.pe.kr/Adding-tag-cloud-and-archives-page-to-Jekyll/">here</a>.  &nbsp;I was surprised to see this worked.  &nbsp;But the formatting took me a couple hours to fix.</p>
  <p>If you want to make a page different from the rest you can create a separate css file and a separate layout page putting them under the corresponding folders.  This has been real fun as I have experimented with background photos for the home page.  A single edit of the hompage index.html from the default layout to the home layout can immediately toggle between the trial vesion and the original version.</p>
  <p>Lastly this site is a work in progress.</p>
