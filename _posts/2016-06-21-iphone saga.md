As I mentioned in my May 25 post, I took my iPhone 6 into the Genius Bar to see why the phone was locking up. &nbsp; Well the "genius" there said my touchscreen was defective after she ran a simple diagnostic on it.  Hmm, it really seemed to be a resource contention issue from my observation. &nbsp; So for $109 they would replace the screen. &nbsp; Okay, I suppose. &nbsp; So I roamed the mall for two hours and when I came back I had to wait for another 15 minutes.&nbsp;  Then they came to tell me the phone still didn't pass their tests so here, you get a brand new phone â€“ and only for the $109 plus tax. &nbsp; Hey, not bad, right? 

Well, it restored from backup very clean so I was happy, for at least a week.&nbsp;  But then I started having little pauses, and yep, it now is as bad as ever.  Sometimes I reboot it four or five times before it starts working.&nbsp;  I think since I restored it from backup and now the same issue is happening on a different phone it may be caused by one of the apps or some corrupt data or a virus. &nbsp; So this morning when it was acting really bad I uninstalled some of the apps I had added this spring.  Some of the job search related apps are a bit sketchy.  &nbsp; Once I did this I got it to work a little better but it is still not right. &nbsp; So now I need to figure out if it is data or a virus.  &nbsp; Swell, I get a new phone and restore from backup so I put the same virus on the phone?   

I blame all this on job searching.  &nbsp; Too many crummy sites.  &nbsp; Too many bizarre emails.  &nbsp; I also blame Apple, because I think they are awfully snooty.   &nbsp;They didn't even look into what processes were running and just assumed I must have dropped the phone. &nbsp;  Needless to say I really miss my Samsung Galaxy.  &nbsp; Runkeeper is much better suited for the Android app too.  So I know my next phone will not be an iPhone. 
 
 *Update - I figured out the culprit application and it was a surprise but since its removal no problems whatsoever. &nbsp; It was the GMail application. &nbsp; I wonder if it is corrupt? &nbsp; Since I'm not a big fan of GMail and it is not my primary email I have been good with it removed from the phone.  &nbsp;  The iPhone has been working well since late June.
