My last post titled "Injury and Running Update" has turned out to be a lark.  My legs remain in a terrible state.  Last night we set off to run our short loop which is 3.8 miles but I ended up walking about 50% of it.  I have barely run/walked since the post last week.  My IT bands seem to be the worst part but I also get sharp pains and twinges in my knees and thighs when I run.  I'm wondering if this is a secondary problem related to diet.  We eat healthy well balanced meals but perhaps I'm missing some key supplement.   I don't take a multi-vitamin so there-in I have something to try.   
 
The IT bands should be rolled but I have not done this either.  I'm too cheap to buy a roller â€“ symptom of unemployment.  I could use a rolling pin I guess.  So I have a couple things to try.  Also more dynamic stretching will help.   
 
I'm concerned I am already getting out of shape.  I have not done a long run into Edmonds in weeks.  And I have not done routine runs in a full week.  So I'm a bit desperate to get out there. 
 
My plan is simple.  I'm going to try the rolling pin for my IT bands and I'm going to take a multi-vitamin.  Beyond that it is just going to take some time.
