My last post titled "Injury and Running Update" has turned out to be a lark. &nbsp; My legs remain in a terrible state. &nbsp;  Last night we set off to run our short loop which is 3.8 miles but I ended up walking about 50% of it. &nbsp; I have barely run/walked since the post last week.  &nbsp; My IT bands seem to be the worst part but I also get sharp pains and twinges in my knees and thighs when I run.  And then there are the shins.  &nbsp; The left one in particular really hurts. &nbsp; I'm wondering if this is a secondary problem related to diet.  &nbsp;  We eat healthy well balanced meals but perhaps I'm missing some key supplement.  &nbsp;  I don't take a multi-vitamin so there-in I have something to try.   
 
The IT bands should be rolled but I have not done this either.  I'm too cheap to buy a roller â€“ symptom of unemployment.  I could use a rolling pin I guess.  &nbsp; So I have a couple things to try.  &nbsp; Also more dynamic stretching will help.  &nbsp;  The shins do weel with a deep rub down.  &nbsp; Last year I had a shin splint that took months to recover so that is a bummer.  
 
I'm concerned I am already getting out of shape.  &nbsp; I have not done a long run into Edmonds in weeks.  &nbsp; And I have not done routine runs in a full week.  &nbsp; So I'm a bit desperate to get out there. 
 
My plan is simple.  &nbsp; I'm going to try the rolling pin for my IT bands and I'm going to take a multi-vitamin.  &nbsp; Beyond that it is just going to take some time.
