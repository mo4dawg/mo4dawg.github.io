I was so happy to proclaim reboot last week but now I'm finding each run to be quite a chore and my knees really do hurt. &nbsp; Today after 3 miles I had to stop and massage my knees. &nbsp;  A deep rub helped so that after I walked a couple blocks I was able to resume running. &nbsp; I've run every second day since the doctor appointment. &nbsp; I just hope I can get back to where I can build on it without worrying about injuries.
