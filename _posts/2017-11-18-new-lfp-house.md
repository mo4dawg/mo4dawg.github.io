Last week Karen and I moved into our new forever home in Lake Forest Park.  &nbsp;It's hard for me to explain how important this is to me.  &nbsp;In 1989 I bought my first house as a 28 year old single dude. &nbsp;It was certainly a starter house, with two bedrooms and a small footprint. &nbsp;But it was mine.

When I was married in 1991 I moved into Suzanne's house. &nbsp;And then again in 2015 I moved into Karen's house. &nbsp;But now Karen and I have moved into a house we chose and bought together.  &nbsp; So for over a quarter century I have in some ways felt I was a guest.  &nbsp; Finally, I have a house I bought with my wife.  &nbsp; What a great feeling.

Now we have a lot of work to do.  &nbsp; Already we've done a bunch.  &nbsp; The family room has been transformed and I replaced baseboards throughout the house with shoe trim. &nbsp;  In the family room all surfaces including the ceiling were patched and painted.  &nbsp; The office was painted and I painted one of the living room walls.   &nbsp; Some outside work has been done as well.

However, the big stuff is coming. &nbsp;We have engaged Dave Heinen our architect because this house has no master bedroom.  &nbsp; We also don't know what to do about the "funky room".  &nbsp; The kitchen is in decent shape but then there is the powder, laundry, utility room combination. &nbsp;What a mess. &nbsp; Also, the electrical is a mess.  &nbsp; The circuits have too much stuff on them and a bunch of the plugs are two-pronged.  &nbsp; They are not grounded.

And then there is the pool. &nbsp;We did not buy the house for the pool, but it was an intrigue.  &nbsp;A costly interest for sure.  &nbsp; The pool deck is a concrete nightmare.  &nbsp; The plaster seems decent.  &nbsp; The heater doesn't work.   &nbsp;I really know so very little about caring for a pool.

Our hope is to start construction in the early spring, perhaps March.  &nbsp;We would love to be done by mid summer.  &nbsp; Hopefully the cost will be in line and we can have minimum debt!
