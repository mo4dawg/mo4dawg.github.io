Yesterday Karen and I were married in a private civil ceremony. &nbsp;And the kicker was that our fathers were the honorary witnesses. &nbsp;Today is a big get together with family and friends. &nbsp; We have put a lot of effort into getting the yard ready.  &nbsp; Karen has people helping with food, even her boss Connie.  

This is the culmination of a turbulent time in our lives. &nbsp; Through the divorce process some people have been hurt.  &nbsp;They may never understand the reasoning behind some of the hard decisions; gut wrenching actions that had to be taken. &nbsp; But bottom line I needed to get out of the trap that I had been in for 24 years.  &nbsp;The kids will never understand, how could I leave their mom?  &nbsp; How can they understand I was living a life that was not mine?  &nbsp; A life that was repressed and throttled?  &nbsp; Devoid of a partner who understood what living really is?  &nbsp;I bottled up my frustrations for literally decades first for her, and then for my kids.&nbsp; So now I have a partner who I consider my physical and intellectual equal.  Perhaps, my superior :)
