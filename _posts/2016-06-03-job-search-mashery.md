No, I'm not talking about Tibco Mashery.  &nbsp; I'm referring to all the weird things we endure as we search for a job.  In an era of identity theft we put our information out there in a lot of places.  &nbsp; Then we have to deal with all the scummy companies that see an opportunity and prey on the unemployed, seeking to appeal to their plight. &nbsp; And also the spam mail and cold calls.

I started the process being somewhat methodical and careful but over the past 11 weeks I have put my information in countless repositories.  Then there is this website.  &nbsp; They call it branding.  &nbsp; Really?  &nbsp; I'm not a blogger so I won't post here often, but I'm pretty tired of having my info out there.  &nbsp; When I have reached my goal I'll probably take down this website too.  &nbsp; I'll keep the domain name though.  &nbsp; At least I own my name!

One of the surprising things I have found in the job search is that I needed to rediscover who I am and what I have accomplished.  &nbsp; I think I've done a lot and covered a lot of ground in my career. &nbsp; It was a couple interview failures that got me thinking, hey, I know more than that.  &nbsp; I just need to recap.  &nbsp; I even considered doing a technology recap blog but that could be messy.  &nbsp; One person asked me about J2EE and I just sat there going um, well...  &nbsp; That's stupid because the CRM application my team built for Nordstrom (called Personal Book) is totally J2EE, Spring framework, SOA, HTML5.  &nbsp; And I know a lot about J2EE, I just didn't have my vocabulary tuned up.  &nbsp; So I have spent some time doing just that. &nbsp;  Most embarrasing was my failure to adequately describe the architecture of our POS systems.  &nbsp; I could do that in my sleep, but I had been so forward focused on Amazon cloud services and J2EE that I blew this simple question.  &nbsp; Another fail: Oh, you were a Unix developer, what is the V tag used with grep?  &nbsp;(answer: it's the inverse of the result, meaning evrything but the result)  &nbsp; Okay, that is just being out of touch for 11 or 12 years.  &nbsp; &nbsp; That was the last time I had a Solaris machine.

Regarding the scammers and spammers.  &nbsp; I have used my trusty hotmail so it's out there.  &nbsp; I have used my GMail account too.  &nbsp; The hotmail account does a better job of putting things into junk where they belong.  &nbsp; I wonder how long I'll be dealing with all the crud that's showing up.  &nbsp; My phone has been cold called a few times just this week.  &nbsp; That's the worst.  &nbsp; I'm not about to change my phone number - yet...
