The injuries are behind me and October has been a great running month with two new PRs for my standard 6.85 mile training run.   &nbsp;This run has some good hills so it is far more difficult than the average half marathon.  &nbsp; Another great thing about this run is that at the 5 mile point I can decide to head into Edmonds and through a couple variations make it 10.5, 11.5, or 13.2 miles.

The total climb on the standard training route is 651 feet according to my trusty RunKeeper app.  &nbsp; Miles 3, 5, and 6 have the uphill and not surprising I always end up with splits over 9 minutes on miles 3 and 6.  

However, I’m still not at the level I was in June, but I’m close.  &nbsp; The 13.21 mile training run I did in June just before the Seattle Rock n Roll half marathon is the only time I have ever posted mile 3 sub 9 minutes, at 8:50.  &nbsp;  I’m pretty sure a couple long runs into Edmonds will improve my PR in the half marathon.  &nbsp; The drop into Edmonds is a beast because I go right to sea level so the total climb for the 13.2 miles is 1233 feet and the killer is climbing out of the Edmonds bowl where mile 11 has a 218 foot gain and mile 12 has an 86 foot gain.  &nbsp; That’s hard!
