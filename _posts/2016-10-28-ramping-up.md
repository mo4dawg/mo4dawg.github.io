The injuries are behind me and October has been a great running month with two new PRs for my standard 6.85 mile training run.  This run has some good hills so it is far more difficult than the average half marathon.  Another great thing about this run is that at the 5 mile point I can decide to head into Edmonds and through a couple variations make it 10.5, 11.5, or 13.2 miles.

The total climb on the standard training route is 651 feet according to my trusty RunKeeper app.  Miles 3,5, and 6 have the uphill and not surprising I always end up with splits over 9 minutes on miles 3 and 6.  

However, I’m still not at the level I was in June, but I’m close.  The 13.21 mile training run I did in June just before the Seattle Rock n Roll half marathon is the only time I have ever posted mile 3 sub 9 minutes, at 8:50.   I’m pretty sure a couple long runs into Edmonds will improve my PR in the half marathon.  The drop into Edmonds is a beast because I go right to sea level so the total climb for the 13.2 miles is 1233 feet and the killer is climbing out of the Edmonds bowl where mile 11 has a 218 foot gain and mile 12 has an 86 foot gain.  That’s hard!
