Yesterday Karen and I went on a nice day hike to Annette Lake near Snoqualmie Pass.  This is a moderate hike about 3.4 miles each way with the first couple miles having a good rate of ascent before it flattens out in the valley as you approach the lake.  Karen and I made excellent time going up and were there in about 90 minutes.
 
We said “hi!” to a lot of polite people and met a lot of frisky happy dogs.  But on the way down we noticed a lot of younger people just don’t get some basic trail manners.  Let’s face it, Karen and I never got passed in either direction because we are fit and were moving fast.  So here are my complaints about the younger generation of hikers:
 
Trail blockers - when someone has caught up from behind you step aside.  We followed on the heels of one couple for nearly a half mile and they were just strolling along but never yielded.  Finally I found a wide straightaway and just blew past them.  Did they get they were blocking?  But hey weren’t the only ones, there were a few others who also blocked for a ways.  I noticed folks over forty get it and move to the side.
 
Crowders - We came to a log bridge and as we were crossing some 20 something dudes on the other side just decided to proceed without waiting for the folks already on the log, basically putting the squeeze on us.  Plus they hugged the west side which had a handrail, exposing those of us already on the log to open air.  Really?  Common courtesy is to let those already on the log to make it across before you proceed.  It was rude.
 
Radio Guy - Yep some young dude decided to have loud music playing while he hiked.  Now there is someone who should never be in the forest - ever.
 
Smokers - don’t even look at me.  Okay, didn’t have any of these guys yesterday, but there have been on recent hikes.
 
So stay home unless you have good trail manners.  You don’t belong on the trail.  I’m good with the dogs.  Yesterday some of the best people on the trail were with dogs and the dogs overall were a joy.  Also it seems those over 40 really are great about trail etiquette.
