After cutting back on my running and a couple doctor visists I'm doing much better.  My lower leg pain seems to be gone.  This week I ran 6.85 miles on Monday and 7.15 miles last night.  Although I was winded I managed to do pretty good hills on both runs and keep my pace on target.  Last night I ran at 9:16 pace.
The doctor visists were to get to the bottom of my lower leg pain.  In the end nothing specific but we were able to rule out deep vein thrombisis (blood clots in the legs).  Phew!  That can cause pulmonary embolisms or strokes.
