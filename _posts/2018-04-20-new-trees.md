The replacement trees in the back are meant to block the view of the derelict house next door - hey there's a blog topic.   &nbsp;The rest of the backyard has very tall arborvitae so that's the perfect replacement.  &nbsp;However I quickly found that tall arborvitae are crazy expensive.  &nbsp;So to be reasonable we got 8 footers which are dwarfed by the existing trees.  Even so, I'm glad for this expense rather than look at the abandoned yard next door.

It doesn't make sense that the 13 new trees we put in do not count towards the replacement canopy for the trees we removed. &nbsp; The city requirement is that we must plabt 450 square feet of replacement canopy anywhere on the property.  &nbsp;But these trees do not count :(  &nbsp;Total cost including drip lines was $3554.  &nbsp;Ouch!
