We closed on the house October 27 and moved in November 11.  &nbsp;During this span I was coming over on a daily basis to work on the house and trim the yard. &nbsp; On the first visit we had a white rabbit hanging out in the yard. &nbsp; Interestingly on my first day as I was leaving my headlights caught a coyote running across the neighbor's yard and driveway.

Somehow that rabbit kept showing up each day. &nbsp; So Karen decided we should feed it as it has gotten colder through November and December. &nbsp; We found the fellow to be a fat, sorta homely dude. &nbsp; He was also particular about what he ate. &nbsp; Lettuce, carrots yes; parsley not so much.

He (is it a he?) is fairly tame and I have been able to come right up with a little plate of food. &nbsp; Who does he belong to? &nbsp; Is he a wild rabbit? &nbsp; I think not as the wild bunnies are all uniform brown. &nbsp; But he might be. &nbsp; Will he survive the winter? &nbsp; Seems like he is well fed, even without our treats. &nbsp; I suppose as long as he is not dinner or road kill he will be just fine. &nbsp; He is quite content hanging out in our front grassy yard.
