After cutting back on my running and a couple doctor visists I'm doing much better.  &nbsp;My lower leg pain seems to be gone.  &nbsp;This week I ran 6.85 miles on Monday and 7.15 miles last night.  &nbsp;Plus we walked about 3.8 miles Tuesday.  &nbsp;Although I was winded I managed to run pretty long hills on both runs and keep my pace on target.  &nbsp;Last night I ran at a 9:16 pace.

The doctor visits were to get to the bottom of my lower leg pain.  &nbsp;In the end nothing specific but we were able to rule out deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs).  &nbsp;Phew!  &nbsp;That can cause pulmonary embolisms or strokes.  &nbsp;I had an ultrasound of my veins and they were clear.  It was fun to do because since I used to develop ultrasound machines at Siemens I was able to talk shop with the sonographer.  &nbsp;This was a GE machine, but the modes and controls are pretty much the same.

So I'm happy to be back on track. :)

*September 27 Update: I ran 3 days in a row Satuday Sep 24 - Monday Sep 26.  &nbsp;Monday was 10.7 miles and I'm happy to say I'm still doing well.  &nbsp;Legs are fine!*
