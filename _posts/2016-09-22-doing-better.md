After cutting back on my running and a couple doctor visists I'm doing much better.  My lower leg pain seems to be gone.  This week I ran 6.85 miles on Monday and 7.15 miles last night.  Although I was winded I managed to run pretty long hills on both runs and keep my pace on target.  Last night I ran at 9:16 pace.
The doctor visists were to get to the bottom of my lower leg pain.  In the end nothing specific but we were able to rule out deep vein thrombisis (blood clots in the legs).  Phew!  That can cause pulmonary embolisms or strokes.  I had an ultrasound of my veins and they were clear.  It was fun to do because since I used to develop ultrasound machines at Siemens I was able to talk shop with the sonographer.  This was a GE machine, but the the modes and controls are pretty much the same. 
So I'm happy to be back on track. :)
