Today I visited my orthopedic surgeon who specializes in knees and I got the green light to run. &nbsp; I've had issues with both knees and decided to curtail the amount I run so as to avoid further injury. &nbsp; After his examination and some x-rays he said go for it. 
 
He had 4 x-rays taken concentrating more on the left but 3 of the 4 actually showed the right knee as well. &nbsp; The right knee has been clicking and he attributed that to cartilage behind the kneecap. &nbsp; It doesn't hurt and he recommended I don't do anything about it.&nbsp;  My left knee has some arthritis and aches in a non specific way. &nbsp; He said it doesn't look bad and to take Aleve. &nbsp; It was interesting but he said running would not really damage it more. &nbsp;  So I choose to believe him :) &nbsp; He's a sports doctor for most of the Seattle professional teams so I think he knows his stuff. 
 
So I'm out of excuses, time to put in some miles. &nbsp; I did run my regular training route Sunday and had some discomfort but the main thing was I got winded. &nbsp;  Well that makes sense, I've run very little for about 6 weeks. &nbsp; I'm far behind where I was at this time last year.  &nbsp; The sad part is that I came into the start of the year in better shape tan last year so I have a lot of work to do.  
 
The weather is slowly turning better so I'm going to go for it. &nbsp; Starting tomorrow I'll try to get into my training routine. &nbsp; Perhaps in a few weeks I can extend it to my long runs where I drop into Edmonds.
