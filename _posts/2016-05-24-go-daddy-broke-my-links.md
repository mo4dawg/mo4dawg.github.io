So I bought my domain name today.  &nbsp; It's good to own your name on the internet these days.  &nbsp; I was surprised to find kevinjconnell.com still available.  &nbsp; It was also cheap!  Below is the link where you can check if your name or some form of your name is available.  &nbsp; If .com is not available then .net or some hyphenation of your name would be good.
