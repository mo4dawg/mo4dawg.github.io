So I bought my domain name today.  It's good to own your name on the internet these days.  I was surprised to find kevinjconnell.com still available.  It was also cheap!  Below is the link where you can check if your name or some form of your name is available.  If .com is not available then .net or some hyphenation of your name would be good.

## [Check for your name here](https://www.godaddy.com/offers/default.aspx?isc=cjc99com&tmskey=1dom_03&cvosrc=affiliate.cj.7790004)

But as luck would have it when I forward my github website to my domain name there is an issue with linking to LinkedIn or hotmail.  The links work if you go directly using [mo4dawg.github.io](http://mo4dawg.github.io) but fail when you use [kevinjconnell.com](http://www.kevinjconnell.com).  This is probably on me, I admit to be a novice web developer. 

So until I correct this I'll continue to use my github URL in my job hunt :)
