title: "I Ran a Full Half Marathon Monday"

This employment interlude which started mid March has been a boon for my running.  I'm not officially training for a specific run, but I have been increasing my distance and working on my pace.  A side benefit is I've lost a few of those midlife pounds I put on.   My weight has consistently stayed in the 179-182 range in May and June after being about 195 around Christmas.  

Over the past ninety days I have increased my distance at least once a week starting at about 8 miles. On Monday I ran a full half marathon distance for the first time.  It covered Richmond Beach, Woodway and much of Edmonds including climbing out of the Edmonds bowl on mile 11.  I started out too fast, as if I were racing.  My splits for the first six miles ranged from 8:14 to mile 6 at 8:53.  If I were in shape the way I want to be mile 6 would have been flat out my first or second fastest mile because it is mostly downhill or flat.  instead I was already feeling drained like my reserves were low.   

The seventh and eighth miles are slightly up hill and I ended up literally stopping for a moment at 6.9 miles and 7.9 miles to catch my breath.  I had a planned water stop at Starbucks on Main Street in Edmonds but due to route adjustments I didn't get their until 9.7 miles.  So miles 7 through 10 splits ranged from 9:28 to 9:59.  I use the pause feature on my Runkeeper app at Starbucks so essentially I cheated.  But I always do this cheat so at least I'm consistent.  At Starbucks I have a routine, I go in and use the toilet (cuz I need to pee) and I use the self service water station.  It's a big water cooler with ice.  I try to hydrate before I run so I have yet to figure out a way to avoid needing to pee after 90 minutes of running. 

After Starbucks I was feeling a bit refreshed and as I ran into a headwind was surprised to actually momentarily feel chilled.  But as mile 11 became the uphill grade out of Edmonds into Woodway I felt myself dead tired, sorta like when I was in poor shape a few years ago.  I just did not have any calories left to burn so there were a few moments of walking and then trotting so that my splits for mile 11 and 12 were 11:35 and 11:49, no longer a runner, just a putz jogger.   I have trained the hill out of Edmonds consistently and generally can keep a pretty solid pace, so this is just a case of it being miles 11 and 12 versus miles 6 and 7.  I need to figure a calorie replenishment strategy.  The good news is that mile 13 was under 10 minutes.  Probably that's the horse heading to the barn syndrome. 

So, at least I accomplished my goal of running a half marathon.  I think a few more runs and I will sign up for the Rock 'n Roll half marathon in July.  But when I look at how drained I was, I really am intimidated about the prospect of ever running a marathon.  How do they do that?  I know that goal is at least a year away if I want to run it rather than walk it.

My final stats for Monday's run are 13.21 miles, 2:06:05, for a 9:33 pace.  According to Runkeeper I burned 1915 calories. I think if I were in an actual event or running with others I would have done a bit better, but I need to not start out with an 8:14 pace.  More like 8:45 and keep it consistent.
