Some moments are defining in the way you grow or persevere and other moments are defining because of the label applied.  Those labels that define you may include parent, teacher, student, drop out, brother and so on.  Last week I got a new label and I'm super proud of it: father-in-law.  My son John was married to a wonderful young woman from an outstanding family.

I admit to mixed emotions about this label because it carries other implied baggage like: old timer, grandpa-to-be, aged.  But I'm not old and I'm young at heart for the years I have accumulated.  My son was married less than a month after he turned 22, so I hereby cast away those labels. 

But can I?  If I mention my son and his wife during a job interview am I sunk?  It wasn't long ago my son's pals and classmates were little kids.  Now when they say "Mr. Connell" to me they are young adults speaking with respect to their elder.  Excuse me.  WTF?   I'm pretty sure I can outrun any of them so long it is over 5K.  But then my dad could do that to me even in my 30's because stamina improves through your 40's and 50's.  So that argument doesn't hold water.

Ah, heck.  I embrace this label and all the great stuff that comes with it.  Here's to John and Kara!  May their life be full of blessings and children.  Hmm... oh, oh.
