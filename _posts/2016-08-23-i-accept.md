Some moments are defining in the way you grow or persevere and other moments are defining because of the label applied.  &nbsp;Those labels that define you may include parent, teacher, student, drop out, brother and so on.  &nbsp;Last week I got a new label and I'm super proud of it: father-in-law.  &nbsp;My son John was married to a wonderful young woman from an outstanding family.

I admit to mixed emotions about this label because it carries other implied baggage like: old timer, grandpa-to-be, aged.  &nbsp;But I'm not old and I'm young at heart.  &nbsp;My son was married less than a month after he turned 22, so I hereby cast away those labels. 

But can I?  &nbsp;It wasn't long ago my son's pals and classmates were little kids.  &nbsp;Now when they say "Mr. Connell" to me they are young adults speaking with respect to their elder.  &nbsp;Excuse me.  &nbsp;WTF?   &nbsp;I'm pretty sure I can outrun any of them so long it is over 5K.

Ah, heck.  &nbsp;I embrace this label and all the great stuff that comes with it.  &nbsp;Here's to John and Kara!  &nbsp;May their life be full of blessings and children.&nbsp;  Hmm... oh, oh.
