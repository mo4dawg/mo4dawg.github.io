Well, I've done it again, another set of running injuries.  I have in recent years developed a pattern of spurious soft tissue injuries whenever I put in a good effort.  This time around I was more careful so as a result I made it most of the past year injury free.  My symptoms are a series of nagging issues particularly with my left leg.  With running injuries I always ask myself what is the source?  Why did the injury occur now? 

Last year I bought a pair of Brooks running shoes that I can certainly put the blame on for my issues including a knee and Achilles tendon issues.  So I immediately dropped that pair of shoes and went back to my standby brand, Asics.  I got super lucky.  I bought a pair of Asics Gel Kayano 21 at the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale with my employee discount.  This was a great pair of shoes.  So after my half marathon a couple weeks ago I knew it was time for them to be retired.  But now Asics had replaced them with the next iteration, Gel Kayano 22.  Ugh, why do they do that?  But a quick Google search found the 21s!  I was able to get them through Amazon from a store in Texas.  The price was good and I was pumped to get them. 

So back to the injuries.  I have terrible tightness and sharp tearing pain on the inside of my left knee.  I can mostly rub this out.  I have a more pronounced pain on my left shin that I cannot rub out.  This is the most debilitating injury.  It may be a shin splint but seems a little higher than previous.  I have tight IT bands on my left side, more so than on my right side.  I know these can be rolled out.

But when did I get hurt?  It wasn't the half marathon.  But it could have been the Beckler Peak hike, where I used my newly retired running shoes as hiking shoes.  Or it could have been my first run with the replacement shoes because every time I have worn them I get the symptoms.  But there is another wild card.  I got another pair of Asics, a different model, last fall that I have been holding in reserve.  I ran with them once or twice after the half marathon, prior to getting the replacement shoes.  One thing I got from those is a sore left heel, right at the base.  Is that the dreaded plantar fasciitis?

So bottom line is I don't really know when I got hurt or with which shoes.  And I haven't been to the doctor because I'm an unemployed dude so I don't really know if these pains will work themselves out.  I have not been able to complete a run without stopping to rub out my leg in over a week.

So, first thing to do is back off.  I've already done that.  Yesterday's jaunt round Lake Union, about 6 miles, became a jogging/walking tour of about 7.5 miles taking over two hours.  We visited the wooden boats and even went to a really cool open house on a house boat.  It was a real fun walk with a little jogging.  Pain was medium in my left leg when we jogged and dull on my left heel when we walked.

Sunday should have been a long run.  Today I might walk the dogs, but only a couple miles.  Tuesday I'll try a 3 mile run, but will stop if I get much pain.  And so it goes, biding my time while these issues resolve themselves.

There's an assumption I'll self heal.  It's my only viable option so I have decided this is my truth.  I'll take it easy and give my tissues time to rest and heal.
