Our house is shaped like a backwards capital L, with the front of the house being the top such that the top most portion of the L is the garage. &nbsp; In 1953 house was a rectangle with a garage making a stubby backwards L. &nbsp; But at some later date they converted the garage into the current family room and added a carport onto the end, thus extending the L. &nbsp; Next they converted the carport into what we affectionately call the funky room and built another garage on the end, thus extending the L even further.

We couldn't figure out what to do with the funky room.  &nbsp;It's cold and drafty and ugly with very low beams. &nbsp; It used to be a billiards room. &nbsp; It has a far-out Fiji mural spanning the entire 20' of the north wall.  

But over the holiday after we had a Husky football bowl game party Karen came up with the new plan. &nbsp; Her genesis was actually the awkward bathroom with the amazing Euro shower located smack in the family room.  &nbsp;It really messes up flow. &nbsp; So her ingenious plan is to remove the bathroom and turn the funky room into a second master suite. &nbsp; Brilliant!

All along we have planned to cannibalize the guest bedroom next to the master and create a master suite. &nbsp; But this would reduce the number of bedrooms from two to three. &nbsp; Karen's epiphany leaves us with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, but we have two master suites! &nbsp;  That's great for when we have visitors.

The other part of the remodel is dealing with the funky powder room that has behind groovy 1960's mirrored closet doors the furnace, hot water tank, and stackable washer/dryer. &nbsp; Be careful, dropping sock into the toilet while unloading the dryer has happened! &nbsp; With the two master suites and the current hallway bath we no longer need this powder room. &nbsp; So we are converting it into a full fledged laundry room. &nbsp;  The washer & dryer will be side by side and the hot water tank will go on the wall as a tankless on demand unit.&nbsp;  The sink vanity will be switched out for a laundry basin. &nbsp; The furnace will remain where it is with some ducting changes. &nbsp; In the end we will have a normal laundry with cabinets and a basin.
