The backyard is all about the pool. &nbsp; It's a concrete jungle that will someday suck about $100K from us as we try to tame it. &nbsp; So, if the pool is the center of the world, why would you let 4 alpine spruce trees grow on the south end? &nbsp; They block most of the sunlight, they drop needles in the pool, they crowd out the upper landing outside the master bedroom, and they block the view from the master. &nbsp; These were trees, likely planted as small ornamentals, that were just ignored until they reached 35 feet high.

Removing the trees has been a top priority since we first bought the place. &nbsp;But it has turned into a real pain.  &nbsp;The City of Lake Forest Park has very strict rules about removing trees with trunk diameters over 6 inches.  &nbsp;One of the trees is scrawny and about dead. &nbsp; The other three exceed six inches.  &nbsp;It turns out that any tree removal of more than two exceeding 6 inches is a major tree removal.  &nbsp;This means we need a permit, an arborist report and pay a big fee.  &nbsp;Furthermore we have 6 months to replace the removed canopy with new trees. &nbsp; Fortunately the replacement canopy can be anywhere on the property.

So the required replacement canopy turns out to be 450 square feet. &nbsp; They gave us a list of acceptable indigenous replacements. &nbsp; We have chosen a specific dogwood to plant in the front yard near the road. &nbsp; It's not a big deal.

These trees were pretty big.  &nbsp;We contracted with Davey Tree to remove the tress and to grind the stumps.  &nbsp;The entire process took a full month with the permitting and getting the arborist report and scheduling the actual work. &nbsp; The total bill was over $3K just to get those trees out.  &nbsp;Part two is to add replacement arborvitae trees with drip lines.  &nbsp;The bid for that is about $3500.
