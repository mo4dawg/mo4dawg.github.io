So, I guess 2017 is not starting out too clean. &nbsp;  Weather has been a factor, and a never ending sinus problem has cut back on the number of runs. &nbsp; But now I have a new injury with my knee. &nbsp; In particular my right knee clicks with every step so I'm real hesitant to over use it. 

My January and February totals are lame. &nbsp; I did not run at all the last week of February because of the knee thingy. &nbsp; I have an appointment with my orthopedic doctor, but it is all the way out to April 11. &nbsp;  That is not good. 

On a brighter note, I did run yesterday. &nbsp;  But I cut it short, to about 4.5 miles because I need to avoid overdoing it. &nbsp; My best run in February was on Feb 13 which is the last time I ran my full training run. &nbsp; That run was 6.85 miles for a 9:33 pace which is a full minute off my October/November pace. 

My goals were to be in the 12-15 runs per month range and to keep my times from falling off too far over the winter. &nbsp; I failed on both. &nbsp; :(  Also my distance per run is down significanty from 6.55 miles per run in 2016.  Hopefully warmer weather and improvement in my knee will allow me to add distance. I enjoy the occasional long run where I drop into downtown Edmonds.  Those tend to be over 9 miles.

So here are the recaps for January and February. 

All runs:
