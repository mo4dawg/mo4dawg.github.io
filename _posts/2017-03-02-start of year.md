So, I guess 2017 is not starting out too clean.  Weather has been a factor, a never ending sinus problem, and Karen's work schedule have slowed things.  But now I have a new injury with my knees.  In particular my right knee clicks with every step so I'm real hesitant to over use it. 

My January and February totals are lame.  I did not run at all the last week of February because of the knee thingy.  I have an appointment with my orthopedic doctor, but it is all the way out to April 11.  That is not good. 

On a brighter note, I did run yesterday.  But I cut it short, to about 4.5 miles because I need to avoid overdoing it.  My best run in February was on Feb 13 which is the last time I ran my full training run.  That run was 6.85 miles for a 9:33 pace which is a full minute off my October/November pace. 
 
So here are the lame recaps for January and February.
