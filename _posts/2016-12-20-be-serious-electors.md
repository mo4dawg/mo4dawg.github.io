What's with the folks selected to be our state's electoral college electors? &nbsp; How were these people picked? &nbsp; Each party selects the electors to represent the voters for that party. &nbsp; The winning party gets to have their electors cast the votes. &nbsp; Since our state voted democratic you would expect our 12 votes to be for Hillary Clinton. &nbsp; Who voted for Colin Powell?  &nbsp; Not me, and I would guess not you. 
 
I get that this was a protest vote.  &nbsp; But let's think about this, why not vote for the one person that might beat Trump? &nbsp; But alas, our 12 votes went 8 to Clinton, 3 to Powell and 1 to a First Nations leader in North Dakota. &nbsp; The only message I see here is immaturity. &nbsp; A childish protest. &nbsp; It's also embarrassing that our state electors do not have perspective. &nbsp; I'm not against protest, but I am against small groups undermining the political process. &nbsp; We can change the electoral college, but we should not disregard it. 

Come on Democrats, you need to pick party leaders and serious electors not some representatives of every odd group for the sake of political correctness. &nbsp; One of those that did not vote for Clinton is a 19 year old woman. &nbsp; This is not a democratic leader or someone whom has enough life experience to understand the implications of such a random vote. &nbsp; Thank goodness only Washington state was this out of tune with our electoral duties. 

Now that the vote is over, go ahead and start the process to change the process if that is the wish. &nbsp; But take a look at the statistics beyond popular vote. &nbsp; I personally like the electoral college because it keeps small states in the race. &nbsp; Their votes can stand out and be counted. &nbsp; Otherwise the results of five or six big states will actually be what counts. &nbsp; No more campaign stops in Iowa or New Hampshire because who would care about these little states? &nbsp; Also, with the electoral college it is possible to have a recount in a state or two but it precludes a national recount. &nbsp; Can you imagine every time we have a close vote we have to have an expensive national recount?   
 
Okay, vote is over. &nbsp; Please take the process seriously. &nbsp; I hate what I saw this week. &nbsp; It's not cool to think you're being cool by messing with the election. 
 
Now carry on.
