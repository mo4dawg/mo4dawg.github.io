Why Did I buy an iPhone?
---

I'm very dissapointed with my iPhone.  Last Spring after a run I dropped my phone while fumbling with bringing in the garbage bin from the curb.  Crack, the screen on my Samsung Galaxy S4 was broken.  I really liked that phone and it was my second phone with the Android operating system so I was good with it.  But, when I went to buy a new phone I was drawn to getting an iPhone 6.  Seems like a lot of the engineers at work had them.  I have had an iPad since 2011 and always marveled at what a cool thing it was.  So, just on a whim I decided to go with the iPhone 6.

Tomorrow I have an appointment at the Genius bar - yes, could not even get in this evening.  It keeps locking up.  It started last week on Thursday and progressed very quickly to the point every time I did something it would lock up.  I could tell it was clocking as some process was hogging all the resources.  So I went to the Apple support site and was instructed on how to reset and restore from backup.  Luckily the most recent backup was less than 24 hours previous.  Fortunately this resolved the issue just before my momentously disastrous trip, *see 2016-05-23 post*.  I was happy with the performance until I noticed a little block Monday night and then more noticable Tuesday morning and an unusable phone by Tuesday night.  Ugh!  So, rather than repeat same steps and get same result I'm taking it to the genius Bar to see if they can determine if there is an app that is causing the problem.
