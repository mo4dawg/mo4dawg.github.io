<h2> About Kevin Connell </h2>
	<h3>Who Am I?   </h3>
	<p>I grew up in the greater Seattle area in what is now incorporated as the city of Sammamish on a 10.7 acre farm with an older brother and sister and younger brother.  Back then it was rural King County.  I attended Redmond schools (Lake Washington School District) from kindergarten through high school.  It was a 7+ mile bus ride each way to Redmond as the closest schools were in Redmond and Issaquah.  I did the usual summer jobs and played soccer for many years.</p> 
<p>My family was into the outdoors things like camping and skiing and hiking.  We got initiated into hiking early.  My first trip up Mt Si was when I was 3!  I remember a 4 day hike over Dutch Miller Gap when I was about 4.  Granted,  as a teenager we could have done the hike in a very long day, but I was carrying my own sleeping bag.  Man,  I was a whiner too!  The cool things we did included summiting Glacier Peak and Mount St Helens in back to back weekends and then skipping a weekend before climbing Rainier.  Not bad for a high school junior. 
<p>After high school I attended the University of Washington and was an obnoxious frat guy.  But hey, those are still some of my closest friends.  A group of us still have Husky Football season tickets together.  <em> Go Dawgs! </em></p> 
<p>In school I eventually ended up with a Business Administration degree and dreamt of working in a high rise in Seattle. Instead I ended up in the dusty basement of a 1920's era warehouse in Portland, Oregon.  Oh well!</p> 
<p>The Portland position was at the distribution center of Meier & Frank department stores.  If you're from Seattle you can equate it to the Portland version of Fredrick & Nelson.  Meier & Frank eventually got swallowed by Macy's.  Anyway, I found myself on the swing shift of this Teamsters affiliated warehouse.  Back then managers all wore suits, boy did that create an unnecessary dichotomy.  Best learning from that job came on the first day when VP Mark Zertanna explained an issue, and followed up immediately that it was my problem now.  I don't recall the issue, but understanding of immediate accountability is not forgotten. </p> 
<p>After nearly four years I landed a job, still in Portland, at Frito-Lay.  The Regional Northwest Headquarters were there.  I was brought in to train and eventually move to an open position in the Seattle area as a Facilities Operations Manager.  The first six weeks were tough.  All employees were initiated by running routes - you know, those Frito Lay step vans.  Well the first thing I learned was how early those guys got going, and the next thing I learned was that boxes of chips were surprisingly heavy.  I have total respect for what they do.  Also, they are salespersons first and delivery drivers second.  If you went to an interview and wanted to be a driver you were out.  But if you said you wanted to be a salesperson, you were in. </p> 
<p>After training I went to Seattle and took over the Everett DC facility and drop locations in places like Bellingham, Mount Vernon, and Wenatchee and eventually was given the Redmond  DC facility as well.  Who says you never go home?  Later I was also given the Auburn DC so at that point I had all of Western Washington operations.  It was a big job for a twenty something dude but I loved it.  Travel became a bit over the top though. </p> 
<p> I met my wife Suzanne in 1990 and we were married in October of 1991.  The humorous thing was Frito-Lay went through a McKinsey study and laid off 1,800 people including me just a couple weeks before the wedding.   So I started my married life off while looking for a job.  There was actually a recession at that time, post the first Gulf War.  It took almost 10 months to land at Pacific Linen, an expanding domestics retailer with stores that had a small footprint.</p> 
<p>Pacific Linen had transitioned from a discounter to a full price retailer.  But the transition was a flop because customers knew them as a deep discounter so the move to full price was not well received.  Also expansion was too aggressive into Canada and into the SW United States.  My position was as Distribution Center Manager.  Over the 3+ years I was there my boss was fired and I took on his role.  About that time we were rolling out to a new Third Party Logistics Company (3PL) in Toronto called Dylex.  I had a couple trips there to make sure the operations and in particular returns were handled well.  Also for some weird reason the leadership thought we should open a pick and pack warehouse in Tukwila.  So,  I embarked on setting up the warehouse pretty much by myself.  I learned about inline sprinkler systems the hard way.  I hired a manager for the facility and eventually had to fire him and hired another guy who turned out great.  Bottom line: Pacific Linen folded and I was on the street looking for work again. </p> 
<p>So, as it were I entered a period of about 4 years where my career was not progressing.  I went to work for Griffin Envelope which was a small envelope manufacturing and printing company in Seattle.  This was a small but very well run company.  I took a massive pay cut, um well, I was unemployed so I settled.  Anyway they sold out to the large national company called Mailwell and I just didn't want to be there.  I learned a lot and got myself started down the IT path there, but it was not the best experience. But then I made the big mistake of running from Griffin Envelope to the worst run company I have ever worked for, McKesson General Medical.  These guys were always under funded, the warehouses were without reasonable technology and were staffed at a level that made basic sanitation impossible.  I worked many nights physically packing to keep the orders flowing.  <em>My salvation was school and family.</em> </p> 
<p>My son John was born in 1994 about a year before I left Pacific Linen.  He had big blue eyes and a blonde head.  He was razor intelligent.  My second son Jackson was born in 1996 while I was at Griffin Envelope.  He has darker hair and brown eyes and a built in diligence.  Both kids have since grown into fine young men.  My family helped me get through the dark days that were McKesson.  We used to hold the kids and dance around and sing to REM's "Shining Happy People" and do all those things you do with your kids. </p> 
<p>So in 1998 while at McKesson I started taking certification classes for C Programming at the UW Extension.  These were night classes and they were my great escape.  I loved being back in school with educated people.  At the same time, my wife Suzanne was instrumental in helping convince the admissions folks at UW Bothell to let me into the Computing and Software Systems (CSS) program.  In late 1999 I left McKesson, having already completed my C Certificate and already full time at Bothell.  That was a hell of a commute at rush hour from Tukwila to Bothell.  I finished classes in Fall 2000 and finished my internship at Applied Microsystems in the Spring of 2001.</p> 
<p>Applied Microsystems was an interesting and fortunate place for me to intern.  I was given a project to write a Unix version of an existing Windows registry browser.  The browser could display the contents of a chipset and show which register values were flipped and what the values were.  I created this monster using Motif which has plentiful memory leaks.  Which is sort of funny because one of the core tools created by Applied Microsystems was to detect/resolve memory and handle leaks.  Anyway I made this thing work, and I think I surprised a few people.  They hired me full time and put me on a cool project called SoftLogic which would emulate a specification for a chip that did not yet exist.  Our primary customer was Lucent Technologies.  Interestingly Applied Microsystems and Lucent both took a dive later that year so I moved on to Siemens Ultrasound.</p> 
<p>Siemens turned out to be a perfect fit, I joined in November 2001.  Both companies used Rational Clearcase, both companies were doing a mix of Windows and Unix work.  I moved seamlessly from my Solaris machine at Applied Microsystems to a Solaris machine at Siemens.  I was able to quickly get my development environment up with Emacs and Bash shell.  Those were the days.  I loved working on the Elegra system.  It turned out in the end I was the last developer still working on the system before moving over to the Windows based Antares platform.  With Antares we built a set of proprietary menu widgets.  After some help on the first one I was able to create my own and eventually took over as the key guy on the menu UI.  Ultrasounds have various modes each having a completely different set of controls and thresholds.  There was B-Mode for black and white, C Mode for Power or Color which based on Doppler effects would show blood flow blue if it moved away from you or red as it moved towards you.  There was Doppler Mode which is an intricate split screen that has a different looking menu, there is M Mode which is temporal and there is 3D/4D.  All of these have their own menuing systems.  In later years I worked on the cardiology platform and eventually a screwball concept called the PizzaBox. </p> 
<p> The thing about Siemens is they had a habit of laying off folks as releases went out and although I was safe, my mentors were mostly gone and  just felt it was time to move on.  Our friend Karen helped get my resume to folks at Nordstrom.  I joined there as a Project Lead in June of 2007.  I was still close to the engineering but I was able to leverage my management background.  I learned a lot at Nordstrom and loved the culture at least until 2015 when things went decidedly south for the company and particularly the culture.  While at Nordstrom I was promoted from Project Lead to Project Manager, then to Sr Project Manager, then to Program Manager which was reclassified as Senior Manager.  My specialty turned out to be the biggest projects running across multiple teams.   As my career at Nordstrom progressed I went from close to the code to close to the process.  I concentrated on continuous improvement and Lean principles and mentoring. I spent nearly nine years at Nordstrom until a layoff that puts me in my current looking for work state. </p> 
<p>So, here I am, unemployed, perhaps having drifted too far from the engineering that I love.   But I still love my kids and family and I am still in a good place as far as my positioning for my career.  We'll see what comes next!</p>
