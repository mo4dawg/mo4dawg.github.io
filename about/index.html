<h2> About Kevin Connell </h2>
	<h3>Who Am I?   </h3>
	<p>I grew up in the greater Seattle area and attended Redmond schools(Lake Washington School District) from kindergarten through high school</p>
	<p>After high school I attended the University of Washington and was an obnoxious frat guy.  But hey, those are still some of my closest friends.  A group of us still have Husky Football season tickets together.  <em> Go Dawgs! </em></p>
	<p>In school I eventually ended up with a Business Administration degree and dreamt of working in a high rise in Seattle. Instead I ended up in the dusty basement of os 1920's era warehouse in Portland, Oregon.  Oh well!,/p>
